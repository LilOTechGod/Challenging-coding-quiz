# Challenging coding quiz

My code quiz is for developers all around the world to challenge themselves in order to see where they're at and where they may need to improve! Based on their score.

## Description

This project was the hardest yet, testing my minds limit although I wasn't able to complete the project. In order to bring this project alive I brought together HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web Api. Using HTML to structure the quiz, used CSS to style the quiz and used JavaScript to interact with the quiz, then Web Api in order to extend the functionality of a web browser. Now this project code quiz is still in construction but, will be updated as soon as possible.

### Installing

Now no folders have to be downloaded or modified in order to apply! Simply press the start quiz button once you've opened the link to the HTML file inside the quiz repository.

## Help

When you find yourself stuck always remember that Google is your friend. Search it up!
